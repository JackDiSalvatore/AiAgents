Bigfoot, also commonly referred to as Sasquatch, is a large, hairy mythical creature said to inhabit forests in North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Bigfoot is featured in both American and Canadian folklore, and since the mid-20th century has become a cultural icon, permeating popular culture and becoming the subject of its own distinct subculture. 

Enthusiasts of Bigfoot, such as those within the pseudoscience of cryptozoology, have offered various forms of dubious evidence to support Bigfoot's existence, including anecdotal claims of sightings as well as supposed photographs, video and audio recordings, hair samples, and casts of large footprints. However, the evidence is a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, and the creature is not a living animal. 

Folklorists trace the phenomenon of Bigfoot to a combination of factors and sources, including the European wild man figure, folk tales, and indigenous cultures. The Patterson-Gimlin film of 1967 arguably cemented Bigfoot into American folklore more than any other sighting in history. 

Recently, a flurry of new Bigfoot sightings and evidence have emerged, causing excitement among the Bigfoot community. Reports of Sasquatch encounters have been captured on both video and camera, with notable sightings reported from Canada to California. For instance, a recent video from Colorado River Expeditions allegedly shows Bigfoot near the upper Colorado River. Additionally, a sighting in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, involved a figure that appeared to be human-sized, if not larger, spotted beyond a fallen tree. 

Despite the ongoing fascination and numerous claims, the existence of Bigfoot remains unproven, and the phenomenon continues to be a subject of debate and intrigue.
